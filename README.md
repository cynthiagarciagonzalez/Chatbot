## RAG Chatbot
Welcome to the RAG Chatbot project repository! This project utilizes the Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) architecture to build a conversational agent capable of retrieving information from local documents and generating responses based on them. We leverage cutting-edge architectures such as Langchain and Hugging Face to empower our chatbot with advanced capabilities.

### Features
Retrieve-and-Generate (RAG) Architecture: Our chatbot employs the RAG architecture, which combines retriever and generator components to effectively fetch relevant information from local documents and generate coherent responses.

- Langchain Integration: We utilize Langchain, a powerful language processing framework, to implement various NLP tasks such as document retrieval, text summarization, and natural language understanding.

- Hugging Face Transformers: Leveraging the state-of-the-art models provided by Hugging Face Transformers, our chatbot is equipped with high-quality language models that enable it to generate human-like responses and engage in meaningful conversations.

- Local Document Retrieval: The chatbot is capable of accessing and extracting information from local documents stored in various formats such as PDFs, text files, or structured data. This allows for personalized and contextually relevant responses.

- Natural Language Understanding (NLU): With advanced NLU capabilities, our chatbot can understand user queries, extract key information, and provide accurate responses by interpreting the context and intent behind the input.

- Modular and Extensible: The project is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to integrate additional functionalities or customize the chatbot to suit specific use cases. Developers can extend the system with new retriever strategies, generator models, or preprocessing modules.
